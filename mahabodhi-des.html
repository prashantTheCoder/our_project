            <h1>Mahabodhi-Temple: A Glimpse into Bihar’s Heritage</h1>
            <p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
The Mahabodhi Temple is one of the most significant and revered Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the world, located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India. It marks the spot where Siddhartha Gautama, later known as Buddha, attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree around 500 BCE. The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of pilgrims and tourists every year.
            </p>
            <h2>History & Significance</h2>
            <p>The Mahabodhi Temple’s origins date back to Emperor Ashoka, a devout follower of Buddhism, who visited Bodh Gaya around 250 BCE and built the first temple structure to commemorate Buddha's enlightenment. The temple has undergone multiple restorations, the most significant being during the Gupta period in the 5th-6th century CE. It is considered one of the earliest examples of brick architecture in India.</p><br>
            <p>The site holds immense religious significance as it is the epicenter of Buddhism, symbolizing Buddha's victory over earthly temptations and his journey to attain nirvana (spiritual liberation). Pilgrims from all over the world, particularly from Buddhist-majority countries like Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Japan, visit to pay their respects.</p>

            <h2>Architectural-Features</h2>
